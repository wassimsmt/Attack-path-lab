# Attack Path Lab – Penetration Testing Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This project simulates a real-world penetration test conducted in a controlled lab environment. The objective was to identify potential attack paths from initial reconnaissance to privilege escalation on a Linux server.

The assessment demonstrates how exposed services, authentication weaknesses, and privilege misconfigurations can lead to full system compromise.

Key findings include:
- Open SSH service exposed on the network
- Multiple failed login attempts indicating brute-force risk
- Full sudo privileges assigned to a standard user account
- Presence of SUID binaries that could enable privilege escalation

Overall Risk Level: **High**

---

## 4. Methodology

The following phases were used during the assessment:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Enumeration
3. Exploitation Simulation
4. Log Analysis
5. Privilege Escalation Checks

Each phase was documented with commands, logs, and screenshots to support findings.

---

## 5. Phase 1 – Reconnaissance

A network scan was conducted to identify active hosts and open services.

### Command Used: `nmap -sS -Pn -T3 <target-ip>`


### Result
- Host reachable
- Port 22 (SSH) open

Evidence:
See `screenshots/port_scan.png`

---

## 6. Phase 2 – Enumeration

The SSH service was analyzed to determine exposure risks.

### Key Findings
- SSH service accessible on the internal network
- No account lockout policy observed
- Potential exposure to brute-force attacks

Evidence:
See `enumeration/ssh_enum.txt`

---

## 7. Phase 3 – Exploitation Simulation

Multiple failed SSH login attempts were generated to simulate brute-force behavior.

### Log Analysis
Failed authentication attempts were recorded in: `/var/log/auth.log`


Evidence saved in: `exploitation/failed_attempts.txt`


Screenshot:
See `screenshots/failed_login.png`

Impact:
Repeated failed login attempts indicate that attackers could attempt credential guessing attacks.

Severity: **Medium**

---

## 8. Phase 4 – Privilege Escalation Analysis

### 8.1 Sudo Permissions Check

Command Used: `sudo -l`


### Finding
The user account has full sudo privileges allowing execution of any command as root.

Impact:
If an attacker gains access to this account, immediate full system compromise is possible.

Severity: **Critical**

Evidence:
- `privesc/sudo_rights.txt`
- Screenshot: `screenshots/privesc_sudo_rights.png`

---

### 8.2 SUID Binary Enumeration

Command Used: `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`


### Finding
Multiple SUID binaries were identified that could potentially be abused for privilege escalation.

Impact:
Improperly configured SUID binaries may allow attackers to execute commands with elevated privileges.

Severity: **Medium**

Evidence:
- `privesc/suid_files.txt`
- Screenshot: `screenshots/privesc_suid_results.png`

---

## 9. Risk Assessment

| Finding | Impact | Severity |
|--------|--------|---------|
| SSH exposed on network | Brute-force attack risk | Medium |
| Failed login attempts observed | Indicates attack potential | Medium |
| Full sudo access for user | Complete system compromise | Critical |
| SUID binaries present | Privilege escalation risk | Medium |

---

## 10. Recommendations

1. Disable password-based SSH authentication
2. Implement Fail2Ban or rate-limiting controls
3. Restrict sudo access using the principle of least privilege
4. Audit SUID binaries regularly
5. Enable multi-factor authentication
6. Monitor authentication logs for suspicious behavior

---

## 11. Conclusion

This lab demonstrates how attackers can progress from reconnaissance to privilege escalation when systems are not properly hardened.

The project highlights the importance of:
- Service exposure management
- Authentication monitoring
- Privilege control
- Continuous system auditing

Proper defensive measures significantly reduce the risk of compromise.
