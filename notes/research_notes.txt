Research Notes – Attack Path Lab

Objective:
To analyze the exposed services and identify potential vulnerabilities that could lead to system compromise.

Observations:
- SSH service was found open on port 22.
- Password-based authentication was enabled.
- No account lockout or rate-limiting controls were observed.
- Multiple failed login attempts were recorded in system logs.
- The user account had full sudo privileges.

Potential Risks Identified:
- Brute-force or credential guessing attacks could succeed without protective controls.
- Full sudo privileges could allow immediate privilege escalation if the user account is compromised.
- Presence of SUID binaries increases the attack surface for privilege escalation.

Conclusion:
The target system demonstrates several misconfigurations that could enable attackers to move from initial access to full system compromise.
