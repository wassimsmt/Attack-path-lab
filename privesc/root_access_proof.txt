Root Access Proof

Objective:
To confirm whether privilege escalation to root level was possible on the target system.

Method:
After identifying that the compromised user account had unrestricted sudo privileges, the following command was executed:

sudo su

Verification:
The identity of the current user was then checked using:

whoami

Result:
The command returned:
root

This confirms that the attacker was able to escalate privileges from a standard user to root access.

Impact:
Root access provides full control over the system, including:
- Viewing and modifying sensitive files
- Installing or removing software
- Creating new user accounts
- Maintaining persistence
- Disabling security controls

Severity:
Critical

Conclusion:
Privilege escalation was successfully achieved due to misconfigured sudo permissions, demonstrating a full system compromise scenario.
