# 🔓 Attack Path Lab – From Reconnaissance to Privilege Escalation

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a real-world penetration testing scenario in a controlled lab environment. The objective was to identify potential attack paths from initial reconnaissance to privilege escalation on a Linux server.

The lab demonstrates how exposed services, authentication weaknesses, and privilege misconfigurations can lead to full system compromise.

This project highlights both offensive security techniques and defensive awareness.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform reconnaissance and host discovery
- Enumerate exposed services
- Simulate brute-force authentication attempts
- Analyze system logs for attack traces
- Identify privilege escalation vectors
- Document findings in a professional penetration testing report

---

## 🧪 Lab Environment

### 🎯 Target Machine
- Ubuntu Server
- OpenSSH service enabled
- Standard user account with sudo privileges

### 💻 Attacker Machine
- Kali Linux
- Tools used: Nmap, SSH, Linux enumeration commands

### 🌐 Network
- Internal virtual LAN environment

## 🧠 Methodology

The assessment followed a structured penetration testing methodology:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Enumeration
3. Exploitation Simulation
4. Log Analysis
5. Privilege Escalation Assessment
6. Risk Evaluation
7. Reporting

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- SSH service exposed to the network
- Multiple failed authentication attempts observed
- User account configured with full sudo privileges
- Presence of SUID binaries that may enable privilege escalation

⚠️ Overall Risk Level: **High**
